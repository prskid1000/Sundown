 * How much to enlarge the interface, from the width of the window.

 * **Density, not a redesign.** Multiplying density scales every dp in the app
 * at once and preserves every relationship between elements, so it cannot
 * produce a layout that was never tested — it produces the tested layout,
 * larger. A genuinely adaptive design, one that spent a wide window on a second
 * column or a wider inspector panel, would be better, and it is a separate and
 * much larger piece of work than this.
 *
 * The steps are coarse on purpose. Continuous scaling reflows text at widths
 * nobody ever looked at; the claim being made here is only that a 44 dp control
 * on a mirrored desktop should not read as a postage stamp.
 *
 * Capped at 1.8x, because past that the interface stops looking scaled and
 * starts looking zoomed — touch targets are sized for fingers, not for how much
 * screen happens to be available.
 *
 * Not a @Composable: it is called from inside `remember { }`, which is an
 * ordinary lambda and cannot host composable calls. The caller reads
 * `LocalConfiguration.current.screenWidthDp` and hands the Int over.
 *
 * Below [WIDE_DP] this returns 1.0f and nothing happens at all, so a phone
 * renders exactly as it did before this existed.
